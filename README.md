# Name-the-state Project! Created this game using (CSV), (Pandas), and (Turtle module). My mother is a teacher so I thought why not create a game that is fun and will help her students. The objective is to guess the state and the state will be placed on the map. If you give up press "Exit" from there the code will create a brand new csv file that shows you all the states you missed.
